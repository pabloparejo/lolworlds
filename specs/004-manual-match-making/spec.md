# Feature Specification: Re-draw stage and teams Drag and Drop

**Input**: User description: "
I want to add 3 important features to the tournament simulation tool.

1. While simulating a round, we could add a small animation to indicate that the simulation is in progress.
The simulation is very fast, but we can add a small delay to increase the hype and excitement of the simulation. For rounds that are best of three or best of five, we can simulate each game with a small delay in between to make it more engaging, and show the score updating in real-time on top of the team name / logo

1. Re-draw stage:
After simulating a round, I want to have the ability to re-draw the matchups for the next round. 
For example, after simulating the 2-0 round, I want to click a "Re-draw" button that will randomize the matchups. This button should be in the title of the group so there is only a re-draw per group and we don't modify other groups.

1. Drag and drop teams
The teams should be draggable to rearrange their positions in the round to be simulated.
ie: In the 2-0 round we would have:
T1 vs GENG
KOI vs G2

The user should be able to drag GENG to face KOI instead of T1.
